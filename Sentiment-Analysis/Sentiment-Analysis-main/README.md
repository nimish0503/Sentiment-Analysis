<h1>Amazon Alexa Review - Sentiment Analysis</h1>

### Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze the sentiment using machine learning classification models. The goal is to predict whether a given review is positive or negative based on the text content.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- sklearn
- xgboost
- wordcloud

### Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text preprocessing
- Count Vectorizer for feature extraction
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

### Output
- Analysed the dataset to understand the distribution of ratings, feedback, variation, and review length.
- Preprocessed the text data by removing stopwords, stemming, and converting to lowercase.
- Used Count Vectorizer to convert text data into a numerical format.
- Built and evaluated Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree classifiers for sentiment analysis.
- Achieved a testing accuracy of around 92% using the Random Forest Classifier after hyperparameter tuning.
